# Heart Disease Prediction System ❤️

## Project Description 📊
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using the Kaggle heart.csv dataset. The dataset contains clinical and demographic features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The model is trained and evaluated using a Random Forest classifier, with data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, feature scaling, and train-test splitting. The project also includes Indian healthcare context business impact analysis to estimate potential cost savings and health benefits from early detection.

## Dataset 📁
The project uses the Kaggle heart.csv dataset, which contains 14 features related to heart disease risk factors and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. The dataset includes clinical measurements and demographic information.

### Features include:
- Age 👵
- Sex 🚻
- Chest pain type ❤️‍🔥
- Resting blood pressure 💉
- Serum cholesterol 🩸
- Fasting blood sugar 🍬
- Resting electrocardiographic results 💓
- Maximum heart rate achieved 🏃‍♂️
- Exercise induced angina 🏋️‍♀️
- ST depression induced by exercise 🧘‍♂️
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment ⛰️
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy 🩻
- Thalassemia 🩺

## Model 🤖
A Random Forest classifier is used to predict heart disease presence. The model is trained on preprocessed data with feature scaling and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

## Business Impact 💰
The project includes an analysis of the potential business impact in the Indian healthcare context, estimating cost savings and preventable cases through early detection.
